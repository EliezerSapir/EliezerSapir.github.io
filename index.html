      <h1>Why start a farm?</h1>
    <p><strong>Our Why:</strong>  
    <p>  At this time, when people lack a connection to the source and are searching for meaning, connecting to how their food grows provides people with an educational and healing experience. </p>
    <p>By having a small farm, we are able to bring food directly to the customer and share the growth process through farm visits, volunteer opportunities and social media. </p>
    <p>It is therapeautic to create a relationship with the plants, help them grow, and be able to receive healthy food and medicine.  This relationship that one builds through assisting a plant through its life cycle allows one to process experiences and be more grounded as a person.</p>
    <p>One of our main goals in having a farm is to bring people together while enriching their connection to the land.  As people are building a relationship with their food, we are also growing our relationship with our clients and their friends and the farm community grows and grow.</p>
      <p><strong>One of our greatest values is community.</strong>  We believe that bringing people together makes the world a better place.  Additionally, working together as a team increases diversity, accomplishes more, and even produces transcendental experiences. </p>
